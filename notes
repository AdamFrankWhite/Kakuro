When passing down clickhandler, when trying to access child props within clickhandler in parent class, make sure to use anon function in the child component, to return a method with the necessary parameters - only way it works

huge bug getting indivual cells to match with state position array - finally realised error in state array, was wrong dimensions, 9 x 10 - should be 10 x 9

selected feature - first though of looping through all all squares, checking if right one, then realised, simple conditional render in cell component


newGame is easy - state makes it so easy, just set won to false

creating function for answerSheet - brilliant - creating a nested array from game module

when game win, stop event listener - solved - added ifplaying conditional

bug: indexing error when randomising game - solution: check to see if randnom === games.length

bug: Click solve before selected, crash - solution: move solve setState out of conditional 

bug: old values still being remembered - issue is emptyBoard, but why? Solution: spread operator only creates shallow copy, so when changing state, you were still changing the original array, needed either separate hard copy, or use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array))

BUGS TO DO


css hover while won=true
layout - responsive winbox
